### Creating an ePortfolio was an awesome way to showcase my academic and personal growth throughout my time at San Jose State University. By documenting my experiences and achievements, I was able to reflect on my learning journey and identify areas where I have grown and developed. Plus, it's a great way to showcase my skills and accomplishments.

### My ePortfolio is currently hosted on Google Sites, I am in the process of transferring over my favorite projects to make it even more comprehensive and representative of my work. I hope to provide a glimpse into my learning journey and highlight the skills and experiences I have gained along the way.
