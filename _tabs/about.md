## Hello! My name is Michelle Navarro
### 

Hello, I'm Michelle. I created this website using GitHUb pages and Visual Studio Code. For now, I am still exploring on what I want this website to become, but for now, I want somewhere to put my thoughts on technology, information, book bans, and any cool project I am working on.  I have a passion for exploring the social web and emerging trends in libraries. I love to create, write, think, and speak about the ways in which libraries can adapt and thrive in a changing digital landscape. Whether through innovative projects or insightful commentary, I'm always striving to bring a fresh perspective to the field of library science. I believe in pushing boundaries and challenging conventions, and I'm committed to making a positive impact in the profession.

# Homelab Topology

I've been homelabbing for years now. Over those years, I have accumulated plenty of details I want to share about the things I have done. However, I will leave the specifics of those details to my individual posts where I will drill into those topics. I would like to use this space, here on this page, as an opportunity to share the overall topology of my homelab in which I operate.

# Services

I also have a high level of curiosity and enthusiasm for digging deeper to understand "why" people do the things they do. This curiosity and enthusiasm allow me to uncover important context and insights that can inform the creation of more effective metadata.
