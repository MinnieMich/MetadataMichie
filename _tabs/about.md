## Hello! My name is Michelle Navarro
### I'm a library technologist based in sunny California. Welcome to my professional blog, where I share my thoughts on library-related topics and discuss my own experiences within the library profession.I created this website using GitHUb pages and Visual Studio Code. For now, I am still exploring on what I want this website to become, but for now, I want somewhere to put my thoughts on technology, information, book bans, and any cool project I am working on.  I have a passion for exploring the social web and emerging trends in libraries. I love to create, write, think, and speak about the ways in which libraries can adapt and thrive in a changing digital landscape. Whether through innovative projects or insightful commentary, I'm always striving to bring a fresh perspective to the field of library science. I believe in pushing boundaries and challenging conventions, and I'm committed to making a positive impact in the profession.
